  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 2025</p>

  <p>At <strong>GoldRateCalculator.in</strong>, we respect your privacy and are committed to maintaining a very simple and transparent user experience. This privacy policy outlines what data we collect — which is practically none — and how we use it.</p>

  <h2>1. No Personal Data Collection</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not collect, store, or track</strong> any personal information from our users. No login is required, and no names, emails, or contact numbers are requested at any point.</p>

  <h2>2. Input Data is Never Stored</h2>
  <p>The data you enter into the calculator — such as weight, making charges, or city — stays only in your browser. It is never sent to a server or stored anywhere.</p>

  <h2>3. Analytics and Tracking</h2>
  <p>We use <strong>Google Analytics</strong> to understand general usage patterns — such as how many users visited the site, which pages were viewed, and how long users stayed. This data is <strong>aggregated and anonymized</strong>. It does not include any personal identifiers.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Links</h2>
  <p>Our website may contain links to external websites, such as gold price sources or articles. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third-party websites.</p>

  <h2>5. Cookies</h2>
  <p>We do not use any cookies for personalization or advertising. However, third-party services like Google Analytics may use cookies to provide their functionality.</p>
