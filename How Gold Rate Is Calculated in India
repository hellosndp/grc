  <h1>How Is Gold Rate Calculated in India?</h1>

  <p>Gold isn‚Äôt just a shiny metal in India ‚Äî it‚Äôs emotion, tradition, and investment rolled into one. Whether you're buying jewellery for a wedding or investing in gold coins, understanding how gold rate is calculated in India can help you make smarter financial decisions.</p>

  <h2>1. Global Gold Prices ‚Äì The Starting Point</h2>
  <p>The base price of gold is determined by international markets, especially the <a href="https://www.lbma.org.uk/prices-and-data/lbma-gold-price" target="_blank">London Bullion Market Association (LBMA)</a>. Prices are quoted in USD per ounce (1 ounce = 28.35 grams) and fluctuate with global factors like inflation, interest rates, geopolitical tensions, and central bank policies.</p>
  <p>If gold is trading at $2,000/oz globally, that becomes the benchmark before local adjustments in India.</p>

  <h2>2. Currency Exchange Rate Matters</h2>
  <p>Since gold is traded internationally in dollars, the <strong>USD to INR exchange rate</strong> directly impacts the domestic gold rate. A weaker rupee makes gold costlier in India ‚Äî even if global prices stay the same.</p>

  <h2>3. Import Duty & Taxes</h2>
  <p>India imports most of its gold, and the government adds duties and taxes that increase the final rate. Key components include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Basic Customs Duty:</strong> ~12.5%</li>
    <li><strong>Agriculture Infrastructure Cess:</strong> 2.5%</li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://goldratecalculator.in">GST (Goods and Services Tax)</a>:</strong> 3% on final price including making charges</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These can add 15‚Äì18% over the international base price.</p>

  <h2>4. Carat Purity Adjustment</h2>
  <p>Gold is sold in 24K (99.9% pure) and 22K (91.6% pure) variants. Since global prices refer to 24K, prices are adjusted for purity before selling 22K jewellery in India.</p>
  <p>Example: If 24K gold is ‚Çπ6,000/gram, the 22K equivalent could be around ‚Çπ5,500/gram.</p>

  <h2>5. Making Charges and Dealer Margins</h2>
  <p><strong>Making charges</strong> (usually 8%‚Äì20%) are added when buying jewellery to cover craftsmanship. Some jewellers use flat rates, others charge a % of gold value. Add a small dealer margin too, which varies across stores.</p>

  <h2>6. City-Wise Variation</h2>
  <p>Gold prices vary between cities due to transport, local demand, and vendor competition. Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai ‚Äî each has slightly different pricing.</p>
